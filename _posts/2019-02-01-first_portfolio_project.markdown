Today I finished my first portfolio project in the course, it was a CLI Gem project,
It was kind of exciting to me going into the project mode weeks, as this is the first time where I got to build something essentially from scratch, rather than following errors based on tests, heh.

The program I decided to build is a program that displays statistics of champions in the multiplayer video game "League of Legends".  So when I initially started working on it, I was actually kind of lost without all the tests telling me what to do, and I started re-reading the requirements and instructions for the project, the video walkthrough helped a bunch and kind of set up an environment to work with thanks to bundle.

I think honestly one of the hardest parts of this project for me was getting it going, I wasn't sure where to start and how to map things out, but once you started a piece, you kind of got the flow of things and I had an idea of what to do next, up until the point that I had to start scraping.

Scraping was abit of a challenge for my project, I went through multiple statistics websites and everytime I tried to pull the information I wanted it was loaded with javascript, almost felt the need to change my project idea, until I found the one website that actually had that information in pure HTML. (Wohoo)

After I got the scraping nailed down, everything just clicked and was smooth from there on, didn't have much issues with implementing the functionality I wanted and I'm pretty happy overall with how it ended up.

So yeah this was my first experience with building something from scratch and I quite enjoyed it, looking forward for the next challenge!
