Hey, so a few days ago I finally finished my last project and I am officially done with the curriculum.

It has been quite a lengthy 11 months and I've managed to learn alot during this course, vanilla & object oriented Ruby,  working with SQL databases, MVC frameworks such as Sinatra and Rails, Javascript, and also learned how to develop one page application with React & Redux for state management.

I wanted to share a few tips if you are planning to attend a coding bootcamp, that I personally think would be helpful from my experience:

1. Make sure to check out the free pre-work part of the curriculum, it will give you a nice base foundation to understand what coding is like and what you are getting yourself into, it will also give you an advantage heading into the main part of the course, you will be familiar with some concepts and you will be able to breeze through the beginning.

2. Plan your week and allocate time to code for a few hours a day, preferably early during the week. I personally wasn't great at planning my time around, but starting your assignments early in the week will allow you see early on if you manage to grasp the new concepts introduced to you, and if you are having a hard time you can consult and instructor and manage your time accordingly as opposed to postponing everything to the end of the week and ending up hitting a wall and run out of time.

3. Make sure to look up additional resources when you are working on something, you are able to find alot of nice information that might spark ideas in your head when working on projects, I personally enjoyed lurking on reddit.com/r/webdev and also read official documentations to really strengthen your understanding.

4. When working on projects and you get stuck and don't know how to proceed, take a break, do something else and you might get an idea in your head on how to solve your problem, and if you don't just come back to the computer after a while with a fresh mind and keep looking for a solution.

Well that's it for me, now it's time to begin the job search journey.
