Hey!

Tonight I finished my first web application project using the Sinatra framework, it took me a while to think of an idea for the project, but I ended up creating MyMovieList which I can probably utilize for my personal use, the idea came from me and my friends like watching movies synced online, but we often struggle with what to watch next, so I decided to create MyMovieList!

MyMovieList is an application that allows users to add movies to their personal movie list, give their own rating, comment on it, and to tag if they've watched it yet or not. Users are also able to share their own profile pages with their list for other people to look at, and perhaps find some cool movies that they'd be interested in themselves based on the comments.

Creating the application was a pretty good experience, I had abit of a hard time starting it out initially because my mind would overload from thinking of how to implement everything at once, but then I just started to work on it one step at a time, I must say the ruby corneal gem was great to get all the structure for the project set up and running. Once I created the user models and views and the movies, I started connecting the dots between them and it was going smooth from there on, lesson learned: don't think too much ahead just start somewhere and see how it goes!

While working on this project after I got most of the functionality done, I was introduced to bootstrap to make the app look abit better, it's a pretty cool front-end web framework that helps you alot with styling your website, so I enjoyed toying around with that, although I haven't done much, it was still cool to see some of the possibilities there are.

Another thing I noticed about myself is that my workflow is weird and I definitely have to work on it, I tend to work on some feature, then a thought crosses my mind, I jump over to another file, and then another and all of a sudden I did 3 different things from my previous commit without being able to pinpoint exactly what it was that I've changed.

That about sums up my Sinatra project!
