Hey!
I just wanted to share abit of my background and the reason why I chose to join a coding bootcamp, so ever since I was a little kid, I loved computers and gaming, I can remember myself using a computer on my father's lap since I was three.
So naturally after the steps of my father who is a Software Developer I was always intrigued by how stuff works behind the scenes.

As I am quite big on gaming, during my teenager years I had interest in modifying game files and seeing how stuff works, so I ended up "building" and hosting private server for some of my favorite games which included some basic coding knowledge to get everything up and running, and also developing addons for the game World of Warcraft.

I ended up taking computer science major in high school together with physics, while spending most of my free time playing games. I tried to make gaming my career and put endless amounts of hours in playing games and becoming better, but after spending about two years trying to achieve that goal I realized that it's just not going to work out and I will have to find an alternative, naturally I turned back to coding and decided to look at options and then I've found Flatiron School and it looked really appealing to me, so that's why I ended up joining a coding bootcamp!
